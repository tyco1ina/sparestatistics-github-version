# About this project

Bowling scorekeeping can be tedious and therefore acts as a barrier to a consistent scorekeeping habit. I built this project to take down this barrier, allowing bowlers a more comprehensive view of their bowling habits. The image processing feature of SpareStatistics is made possible by Amazon Web Services' OCR service, Amazon Textract. Textract reads the scorecard image sent by the bowler and returns the scorecard in text, allowing for a nearly automatic scorekeeping process.
